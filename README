 This is a readme.

 More than just a blank slate, this is where the purpose of my project is described.
 
 At this point, the project is still not described.

 Still waiting.

 These are dot files. As such, their names begin with "dot".

 
INSTALLATION

 *  Download all inclosed files.
 2. Print out files on greenbar, 9 edge first
 *  Take picture of files on wooden table
 *  Use gocr to convert these files back into text
 *  goto step 3
 *  Just kidding, there was no step three.
 *  Copy these files into your home directory, overriding any existing files with the same names
 *  DO NOT attempt to view the contents of any files being overwritten, or the new versions from this repository.  THat would spoil the surprise!
 *  Reboot your computer and (very important) unplug and reseat the third upstream ethernet jack any packets would take heading towards my secret router 224.0.0.27. If you are at a public wifi location, you may have to ask politely in order to effect this.
 *  You're done! Enjoy!

BUGS
